# CholeME Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Deploy to Render (RECOMMENDED - FREE & EASY)

### Prerequisites
1. Create a free GitHub account (if you don't have one): https://github.com
2. Create a free Render account: https://render.com

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Your project is already set up! All required files are in place:
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` (lists all Python packages)
- ‚úÖ `app.py` (main application)
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` (prevents unnecessary files from uploading)

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `choleme-predictor`
3. Description: "CholeME - AI-powered cholesterol level predictor"
4. Make it Public (required for free tier)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Upload Code to GitHub

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Abhishek Chandra\Documents\Personal(ForRicky)\Projects\cholesterol_predictor"

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - CholeME cholesterol predictor"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/choleme-predictor.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If git asks for credentials, use your GitHub username and create a Personal Access Token:
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Generate new token (classic)
- Select "repo" scope
- Use the token as your password

### Step 4: Deploy on Render

1. Go to https://render.com and sign in
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your `choleme-predictor` repository
5. Configure:
   - **Name**: `choleme-predictor`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Instance Type**: `Free`

6. Click "Create Web Service"

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment

- Render will automatically build and deploy your app (takes 2-3 minutes)
- You'll get a URL like: `https://choleme-predictor.onrender.com`
- Your app is now live! üéâ

## Option 2: Deploy to PythonAnywhere (Alternative)

### Step 1: Create Account
1. Go to https://www.pythonanywhere.com/registration/register/beginner/
2. Choose a username (this will be in your URL)
3. Free tier is perfect for this app

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Click "Files" tab
2. Create folder: `cholesterol_predictor`
3. Upload all your files:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `templates/` folder
   - `model/` folder
   - `data/` folder

### Step 3: Setup Virtual Environment
Open a Bash console and run:
```bash
mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.10 choleme
pip install -r cholesterol_predictor/requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Web App
1. Go to "Web" tab
2. Click "Add a new web app"
3. Choose "Flask"
4. Python version: 3.10
5. Path to Flask app: `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/cholesterol_predictor/app.py`
6. Set virtualenv: `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.virtualenvs/choleme`

### Step 5: Configure WSGI
Edit WSGI configuration file:
```python
import sys
path = '/home/YOUR_USERNAME/cholesterol_predictor'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

from app import app as application
```

7. Click "Reload" to start your app
8. Visit: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.pythonanywhere.com`

## Option 3: Railway (Fast Deployment)

### Step 1: Create Account
- Go to https://railway.app
- Sign in with GitHub

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your `choleme-predictor` repo
4. Railway auto-detects Python and deploys!
5. Click "Generate Domain" to get your URL

## Important Notes

### File Size Limits
- Model files (`model/cholesterol_model.pkl`) might be large
- If deployment fails due to size:
  1. Compress the model
  2. Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
  3. Or retrain with a simpler model

### Environment Variables (if needed)
Most platforms let you set environment variables:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add any sensitive data there (API keys, etc.)

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Render**: App sleeps after 15 min of inactivity (wakes up automatically when visited)
- **PythonAnywhere**: Limited CPU, no always-on
- **Railway**: 500 hours/month free
