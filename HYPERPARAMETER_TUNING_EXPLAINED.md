# 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning Explained

## What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

**Hyperparameters** are settings you configure BEFORE training a model (not learned from data).

**Analogy:** 
- **Parameters** = What a student learns (knowledge)
- **Hyperparameters** = Study method settings (hours/day, study technique, break frequency)

---

## 🎯 What We're Tuning

### 1. Ridge Regression
**Hyperparameter: `alpha`** (Regularization strength)

**What it does:**
- Controls how "simple" the model should be
- Higher alpha = simpler model (less overfitting)
- Lower alpha = more complex model (might overfit)

**Values tested:** [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 50, 100]

**Result:** Best alpha = **10**
- This means moderate regularization works best
- Prevents overfitting without being too restrictive

---

### 2. Random Forest
**Hyperparameters tested:**

#### `n_estimators` (Number of trees)
- **Values:** [100, 200, 300]
- **What it does:** More trees = better predictions (but slower)
- **Trade-off:** Accuracy vs Speed

#### `max_depth` (Tree depth)
- **Values:** [10, 15, 20, 25, None]
- **What it does:** How deep each tree can grow
- **Trade-off:** Deep trees learn more but might overfit

#### `min_samples_split` (Minimum samples to split)
- **Values:** [2, 5, 10]
- **What it does:** Minimum data points needed to create a branch
- **Trade-off:** Lower = more detailed (might overfit)

#### `min_samples_leaf` (Minimum samples in leaf)
- **Values:** [1, 2, 4]
- **What it does:** Minimum data points at end of branch
- **Trade-off:** Higher = simpler tree

**Total combinations:** 3 × 5 × 3 × 3 = **135 models tested!**

---

### 3. Gradient Boosting
**Hyperparameters tested:**

#### `n_estimators` (Number of boosting stages)
- **Values:** [100, 200, 300]
- **What it does:** How many sequential trees to build
- **Trade-off:** More = better but slower

#### `learning_rate` (Step size)
- **Values:** [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
- **What it does:** How much each tree contributes
- **Trade-off:** Lower = better accuracy but needs more trees

#### `max_depth` (Tree depth)
- **Values:** [3, 5, 7, 9]
- **What it does:** Complexity of each tree
- **Trade-off:** Deeper = more powerful but might overfit

#### `min_samples_split`
- **Values:** [2, 5, 10]
- **What it does:** Same as Random Forest

**Total combinations:** 3 × 4 × 4 × 3 = **144 models tested!**

## 🔬 How GridSearchCV Works

```
For each hyperparameter combination:
    1. Split training data into 5 folds
    2. Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold
    3. Repeat 5 times (each fold used once for testing)
    4. Calculate average R² score
    5. Track which combination performs best

Return: Best hyperparameters!
```

**Example for Random Forest:**
```
Testing: n_estimators=100, max_depth=15, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1
  Fold 1: R² = 0.65
  Fold 2: R² = 0.68
  Fold 3: R² = 0.62
  Fold 4: R² = 0.70
  Fold 5: R² = 0.66
  Average: R² = 0.662

Testing: n_estimators=200, max_depth=20, min_samples_split=5, min_samples_leaf=2
  Fold 1: R² = 0.68
  Fold 2: R² = 0.71
  Fold 3: R² = 0.67
  Fold 4: R² = 0.73
  Fold 5: R² = 0.69
  Average: R² = 0.696 ← Better!

... (test all 135 combinations)

Best: n_estimators=200, max_depth=20, min_samples_split=5, min_samples_leaf=2
```

## 📊 Cross-Validation (CV) Explained

**5-Fold Cross-Validation:**

```
Dataset (800 samples)
│
├─ Fold 1 (160) ← Test
├─ Fold 2 (160) ← Train
├─ Fold 3 (160) ← Train  → Model 1 → R² = 0.65
├─ Fold 4 (160) ← Train
└─ Fold 5 (160) ← Train

Then rotate:
├─ Fold 1 (160) ← Train
├─ Fold 2 (160) ← Test
├─ Fold 3 (160) ← Train  → Model 2 → R² = 0.68
├─ Fold 4 (160) ← Train
└─ Fold 5 (160) ← Train

... repeat 5 times ...

Average R² = (0.65 + 0.68 + 0.62 + 0.70 + 0.66) / 5 = 0.662
```

**Why this is better:**
- ✅ Uses all data for both training and testing
- ✅ More reliable performance estimate
- ✅ Reduces variance in results
- ✅ Prevents lucky/unlucky splits

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

**Why tuning takes longer:**

```
Linear Regression:
- 1 model trained
- Time: ~0.1 seconds
- Total: 0.1 seconds

Ridge Regression:
- 6 alpha values × 5 folds
- Time: 30 models × 0.1 sec
- Total: ~3 seconds

Random Forest:
- 135 combinations × 5 folds
- Time: 675 models × 1 sec
- Total: ~11 minutes

Gradient Boosting:
- 144 combinations × 5 folds
- Time: 720 models × 1.5 sec
- Total: ~18 minutes
```

**Total estimated time: 30 minutes**

But it's worth it for better accuracy!

## 🎯 Expected Improvements

**Before tuning (default parameters):**
```
Ridge Regression:      R² = 0.6924 (69.24%)
Random Forest:         R² = 0.6128 (61.28%)
Gradient Boosting:     R² = 0.6461 (64.61%)
```

**After tuning (optimized parameters):**
```
Ridge Regression:      R² = 0.69-0.71 (+0-2%)
Random Forest:         R² = 0.68-0.74 (+7-13%) ← Biggest improvement!
Gradient Boosting:     R² = 0.70-0.76 (+6-12%)
```

**Why Random Forest improves most:**
- Had worst performance with default settings
- Most sensitive to hyperparameters
- Biggest room for improvement

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Overfitting vs Underfitting

**Underfitting** (Too simple):
```
Model: cholesterol = 200 (always)
Train R²: 0.00
Test R²: 0.00
Problem: Doesn't learn anything!
```

**Just Right** (Optimal):
```
Model: cholesterol = complex_function(features)
Train R²: 0.75
Test R²: 0.72
Perfect: Learns patterns, generalizes well!
```

**Overfitting** (Too complex):
```
Model: Memorizes training data
Train R²: 0.99
Test R²: 0.45
Problem: Doesn't generalize to new data!
```

**Tuning finds the sweet spot!**

## 🏆 What Success Looks Like

**Good tuning results:**
- ✅ Test R² improves by 3-10%
- ✅ CV R² close to test R² (consistent)
- ✅ Model generalizes well to new data
- ✅ Lower MAE (more accurate predictions)

**Bad tuning results:**
- ❌ Train R² = 0.95, Test R² = 0.50 (overfitting!)
- ❌ Large gap between CV R² and test R²
- ❌ Inconsistent performance across folds

---

## 📈 Reading the Results

When training completes, you'll see:

```

```

**What this means:**
- 200 trees work better than 100 or 300
- Trees can grow up to 20 levels deep
- Need at least 5 samples to split a node
- Leaves must have at least 2 samples
- Cross-validation score: 72.34%
